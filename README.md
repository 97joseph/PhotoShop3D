• InDesign & Photoshop
• Copywriting
• Storytelling
• Writing for Radio
• Typography
• Graphic Design and Layouts
• Art Direction
You will use these newfound skills to create, develop, design, execute and deliver a PDF of industry standard
work. The PDF will consist of ONE piece of work:
• A 360-degree campaign for a brand/product you’ve been given in the workshop in class. based on a
maximum of THREE executions across THREE different media:
o One Print Ad with body copy
o One Poster Ad
o One Radio Ad as a script or as a finished recorded audio file
(All the Print and Poster work should be developed, at the very least, to scamp standard. If you have access to the
Adobe suite and can use Photoshop and InDesign, great; But it is NOT compulsory. A scamp is fine).
